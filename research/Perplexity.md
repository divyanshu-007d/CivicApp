# see i have decided to keep the following features:-

1. Citizen App:-
Features:-
2. One tap report submission
When a user clicks on the complaint button , directly open the camera , user takes the picture , automatically fetch the time , geolocation , and then process the image , and that thing is then sent to the ai so the ai can assess the image and then  generate a json based report for that issue. in the desired language for the user. it automatically classifies the complaint to the specific category , departement severity.
3. multi -platform
the code will be in expo , so the app can run on android ios web simultaneously.,
4. multi lingual voice assistant and multi lingual app
as soon as the user opens the app , the app automatically sets the location of the user's app. and language too. which he cna change later.
the ai assitant will be answering all the queries for the user. supports , image , text , voice etc.
it will answer all the queries related to the app or general knowledge as well .
4.complaints section
compalints will be public
they could be upovoted , just like reddit or quora.
that creates urgency too solve that complaint more fast.
also a map will be there , which shows the current , or past complaints in an area , and there resolution (an interactive way to see the complaints)
5. a multi channel method to access the complaints  and other features via :-
6. whatsapp bot
7. telegram bot
8. discord bot
9. realtime notifications to user regarding via mutliple channels :-
phone , email , text , whatsapp , push notifications.
10. leaderboard and gamification
points for complaints , resolution etc.
leaderboards , which shows , neigbourhood leaderboard , city leaderboard , state leaderboard for individuals , and for the cities as well.
and states too.
which creates a kind of competition among the citizens to complaint , and resolve to be the best city in india , or state in india.
LOr for the individual to shine among their locality.
also they will get badges which they can share among social media for recoginition>
they will receive certficates as well.
9.social media sharing , users could share there badges , or leaderboard rankings on social media .
11. referals , user can refer other users to join the app (works same in a gamified way , the one doing the referal receives points  for being a good citizens , we could give him badges like mukhiya (refer 10 people) , mahapor( 100 people) , pradhan mantri (1000 people referred).
(if you want to tell features , other than these , tell me that too)
----------------------------------
2. field engineer app
features:-
3. view tasks assigned to them.
4. view tasks in an area on the map(same map as in the user's app)
5. can see the task , realted pics , complaint etc. once complete , takes picture of that place for a one tap resolution.
Like the picture , which he clicks , will be sent to the ai , ai compares the before , and after pictures .
and then if there is really some improvemnet , it approves , else it rejects the request.
6. leaderboard and gamification ( shows the top field engineer in an area , a chance to be respected by others in their area)
7. commuications options for them to contact the admin , the complainer .
-------------------------------
3. dashboard
feature:-
1.Complaint Management Dashboard:
Filter, categorize, prioritize, and track complaints by location, type, or urgency.
4. Automated Routing for Task Allocation:
AI or rule-based system to assign complaints to the correct department or worker automatically.
5. Analytics \& Reporting:
Visual reports and KPIs on complaint volumes, resolution times, department performance, and trends.
4.User \& Role Management:
Manage access for officials, engineers, and other stakeholders with role-based permissions.
also being able to add the field engineers , etc.
6. this dashboard will be for the different department officials .
so i guess , the backend will automatically show them the specific complaints , depends on the user type.
if the user is super admin he can see all the reports , and if he is from a spefici department , he can see reports for his department.
(any other feature to make it stand out , or easier for the departments in the back ??)
------------------------------------------------------------
tech stack :-
react native expo(android/ios/web) for the apps.
next.js for the dashboard for the admins .
----------------
backend : node.js
db : postgresql
and then via postman , will be creating a documentation for the apis , so that they can be integrated later to:-
whatsapp
telegram
discord
etc.
for ai capabilities , we will be using gemini , i hope that can process , image , voice , text , video , like it is multi-modal.
if you can suggest better backend then do that too
-----------
there will be some external apis , which can be shared to the other department if needed for analtytics. (public data only such as complaints , resolutions , timing in that , department wise , stateie , city wise etc.) could be used by gov.
---------------------

so now my task is to create  a presentation for this for sih.

and then a landing page.

and then the db schema , backend design , then ui/ux  then coding them , and connecting them togehter .

I will be relying heavily on ai copilot , gamma like tools to fasten up the process.

so for ai context , and for me also , so that i rememeber this proejct , create a project report.covering  what all things i mentioned above(dont levae a single point)

tech stack , features , usp , different apps , etc.

and also create a ppt-template-prompt for gamma to create a ppt like this:-

# Project Report: Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System

## 1. Introduction

Local governments struggle to identify, prioritize, and resolve everyday civic issues promptly. Citizens face difficulties reporting and tracking problems like potholes, streetlight faults, and trash bin overflows. This project proposes a mobile-first system that streamlines issue reporting, leveraging AI for classification and conversational assistance, while empowering citizens and officials for faster resolutions.
