# Project Report â€“ Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System

## 1. Project Overview
Local governments often struggle with identifying, prioritizing, and resolving civic issues like potholes, garbage, and streetlight failures. This project aims to build a **scalable, AI-driven, gamified civic-tech platform** where **citizens, field engineers, and government departments collaborate seamlessly**.

The ecosystem will consist of:
- **Citizen App (React Native + Expo)** â€“ for reporting and tracking complaints.
- **Field Engineer App** â€“ for task resolution with AI-powered verification.
- **Government/Admin Dashboard (Next.js)** â€“ for complaint management, routing, and analytics.
- **Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)** â€“ scalable APIs with future integration support for WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord.
- **AI (Gemini multimodal)** â€“ to process images, voice, text, classify issues, and verify resolutions.

3. **Multi-Lingual Voice Assistant**
   - Auto-detects location & language.
   - AI assistant answers queries (app usage + general knowledge).
   - Supports text, voice, image queries.

4. **Complaints Section (Public & Interactive)**
   - Complaints visible to all â†’ can be **upvoted** (Reddit-style).
   - Heatmap & interactive map to visualize active & resolved complaints.

5. **Multi-Channel Access**
   - Complaints and status available via **WhatsApp bot, Telegram bot, Discord bot**.

6. **Real-Time Notifications**
   - Multiple channels: app push, SMS, WhatsApp, email.

7. **Gamification & Leaderboards**
   - Points for complaint reporting, referrals, resolutions.
   - Leaderboards: neighborhood, city, state â†’ for both individuals and regions.
   - Badges & certificates â†’ shareable on social media.

8. **Referrals**
   - Reward system for inviting users.
   - Titles like *Mukhiya* (10 referrals), *Mahapaur* (100 referrals), *Pradhan Mantri* (1000 referrals).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Field Engineer App
1. **Assigned Tasks** â€“ View tasks on map + details.
2. **Resolution Workflow**
   - Upload *after picture*.
   - AI compares *before vs. after* â†’ approves/rejects based on improvement.
3. **Leaderboard & Recognition** â€“ Top engineers highlighted for efficiency.
4. **Communication Tools** â€“ Contact admins & complainants directly.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Government/Admin Dashboard
1. **Complaint Management Dashboard**
   - Filter by type, severity, department, location.
   - Track complaints in real-time.

2. **Automated Routing**
   - AI-based auto-allocation of tasks to right departments/engineers.

3. **Analytics & Reporting**
   - KPIs: avg. resolution time, pending vs resolved issues, department-wise performance.
   - Heatmaps for high-complaint zones.

4. **User & Role Management**
   - Role-based access (Super Admin, Department Head, Engineer).
   - Super Admin sees all data; Department Heads see filtered issues.

5. **External APIs**
   - Public API for transparent analytics (city, state, department performance).
   - Useful for policy-making, researchers, and citizens.

## 3. Tech Stack
- **Citizen & Engineer App:** React Native (Expo), supports Android, iOS, Web.
- **Dashboard:** Next.js (React framework for fast rendering + scalability).
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express (scalable API-driven architecture).
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (structured + geospatial data), plus object storage (e.g., AWS S3) for images.
- **AI/ML:** Gemini API (multimodal â†’ handles images, text, voice). For fallback â†’ TensorFlow/PyTorch for custom models.
- **Maps:** Google Maps API / OpenStreetMap.
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging, Twilio, WhatsApp Cloud API.
- **Hosting & Cloud:** AWS / GCP / Azure.
- **Documentation:** Postman for API design, testing, and future integrations.

Alternative backend consideration:
- **Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin)** â†’ enterprise stability, but heavier.
- **Nest.js (TypeScript)** â†’ structured Node.js framework, could improve scalability & maintainability.

## 4. Unique Selling Propositions (USP)
- **AI-powered classification & resolution verification.**
- **Gamified citizen engagement â†’ competition among neighborhoods/states.**
- **Multi-channel accessibility (App + WhatsApp + Telegram + Discord).**
- **Decentralized transparency â†’ public complaints visible + upvotes.**
- **Scalable backend & open data APIs â†’ encourages government adoption.**

---

## 5. Feasibility & Viability
- **Feasibility:**
   - Uses proven tech (React Native, Node.js, Postgres, cloud infra).
   - Scalable â†’ can start with one city, expand to state/nation.

- **Challenges:**
   - Government adoption & training staff.
   - Ensuring accurate AI classification.
   - Preventing spam/false complaints.

- **Solutions:**
   - Training modules for officials.
   - AI moderation + human review.
   - Gamification + verified profiles to reduce spam.
